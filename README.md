# gdps-autosetup
cool little tool i made for automating replacing url endpoints in GD  
makes it super simple and works out of the box with [gd-anime-ps](https://github.com/koneko/gd-anime-ps)  
# setup
setup is very simple  
1. clone the repo
2. open `endpoints.txt` and change your endpoints in this format (you can but dont have to put new lines)
